## Scalable Video Coding

[Scalable Video Coding (SVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Video_Coding) is a video compression standard that defines encoding of a high-quality video bitstream that also contains one or more subset bitstreams (a form of layered coding). A subset video bitstream is derived by dropping packets from the larger video to reduce the bandwidth required for the subset bitstream. The subset bitstream can represent a lower spatial resolution (smaller screen), lower temporal resolution (lower frame rate), or lower quality video signal.
