## Color Space

A [color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space) is the set of colors and luminance values which can be captured, stored or displayed in a medium.

The [CIE 1931 color spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space) are the first defined quantitative links between distributions of wavelengths in the electromagnetic visible spectrum, and physiologically perceived colors in human color vision. They were created by the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination) in 1931 from a series of experiments that were combined into the specification of the CIE RGB color space, from which the CIE XYZ color space was derived.

## Color Model

A [color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model) is a method to represent colors, typically as tuples of three or four values or components.
