## Color Space

A [color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space) is the set of colors and luminance values which can be captured, stored or displayed in a medium.

The [CIE 1931 color spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space) are the first defined quantitative links between distributions of wavelengths in the electromagnetic visible spectrum, and physiologically perceived colors in human color vision. They were created by the [International Commission on Illumination (CIE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Illumination) in 1931 from a series of experiments that were combined into the specification of the CIE RGB color space, from which the CIE XYZ color space was derived.

In the black band are represented the [spectral colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color), colors in a relatively narrow band of wavelengths, also known as monochromatic light. Values are expressed in nanometers. This diagram gives a common frame to define color spaces in `xyY` coordinates where `xy` is `chrominance` and `Y` is `luminance`.

A color space represents a [gamut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut), a set of colors that can be represented, and is defined by:
* Primary colors (R,G,B).
* [White point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_point). Color spaces use [illuminants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Color_temperature_white_points) to define reference whites, each illuminant has a [correlated color temperature (CCT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature#Correlated_color_temperature). The commonly used standard illuminant is [D65](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminant_D65) at 6504 K.
* [Transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function). [Gamma correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction) is a non-linear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values. It is used to take advantage of the non-linear manner in which humans perceive light and color.

Converting color spaces depend on the `primary colors` and `white points` and must be done with `lineal values`. There are several lists of [matrices](http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?Eqn_RGB_XYZ_Matrix.html) to convert RGB/XYZ and XYZ/RGB.

RGB(709)/RGB(2020) (assuming same white points)
```
XYZ = RGB709_TO_XYZ_MAT * RGB(709)
RGB(2020) = XYZ_TO_RGB2020_MAT * XYZ
```

XYZ(D50)/XYZ(D65)
```
LMS(D50) = XYZ_TO_LMS_MAT * XYZ(D50)
LMS(D65) = D50_TO_D65_CAT * LMS(D50)
XYZ(D65) = LMS_TO_XYZ_MAT * LMS(D65)
```
White points conversion matrices are called [Chromatic Adaptation Transform (CAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_adaptation) and are equivalent to apply a [white balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_balance).

XYZ/xyY
```
x = X / (X + Y + Z)
y = Y / (X + Y + Z)
Y = Y
```
For black, `X=Y=Z=0`, set `x` and `y` to the chromaticity coordinates of the reference white.

## Color Model

A [color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_model) is a method to represent colors, typically as tuples of three or four values or components. An image can be represented in memory component-wise or planar-wise.

* Packed formats are represented in memory [X<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>1</sub>...X<sub>n</sub>Y<sub>n</sub>Z<sub>n</sub>].
* Planar formats are represented in memory [X<sub>1</sub>...X<sub>n</sub>] [Y<sub>1</sub>...Y<sub>n</sub>] [Z<sub>1</sub>...Z<sub>n</sub>].
* Semi-Planar formats are represented in memory [X<sub>1</sub>...X<sub>n</sub>] [Y<sub>1</sub>Z<sub>1</sub>...Y<sub>n</sub>Z<sub>n</sub>].
* Interleaved formats are represented in memory following a [sampling system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling#Sampling_systems_and_ratios), sampling is expressed as a three part ratio `J:a:b`. For example 4:2:2 has the `Y` and `Z` planes subsampled, they have less information than the `X` plane, [X<sub>1</sub>Y<sub>1</sub>X<sub>2</sub>Z<sub>1 </sub>X<sub>3</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>Z<sub>2</sub>...X<sub>n-1</sub>Y<sub>m</sub>X<sub>n</sub>Z<sub>m</sub>].

### RGB

[RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) is an [additive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color) color model with a separation of `red`, `green` and `blue` [additive primary colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_color).

<p align="center">Additive Color Mixing</p>

When the red, green and blue components have the same range of values the geometric representation has the shape of a cube otherwise it has the shape of a rectangular prism or cuboid.

There are several [RGB pixel formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monochrome_and_RGB_color_formats), the most common formats are:
* RGB888 or RGB24, uses 24 bits (8 bits per component).
* RGB565, uses 16 bits (5 bits R, 6 bits G and 5 bits B).

### CMY

[CMY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMY_color_model) is a [subtractive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color) color model with a separation of `cyan`, `magenta` and `yellow` [subtractive primary colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_color#Subtractive_mixing_of_ink_layers).

### HSL/HSV

[HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) is a color model with `hue`, `saturation` and `level` components.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="30%" height="30%" src="hsl_cylinder.png"></p>
<p align="center">HSL Color Range</p>

[HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) is a color model with `hue`, `saturation` and `value` components (also known as HSB, `hue`, `saturation` and `brightness`).

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="30%" height="30%" src="hsv_cylinder.png"></p>
<p align="center">HSV Color Range</p>

Both color ranges shapes are cylindrical.
* Hue, the angular dimension, starts at the red primary at 0째, passes through the green primary at 120째 and the blue primary at 240째, and then back to red at 360째.
* The central vertical axis is the achromatic grayscale range, from top to bottom, white at lightness 1 to black at lightness 0.
* Primary and secondary colors are around the outside edge of the cylinder with saturation 1. These saturated colors have lightness 0.5 in HSL and value 1 in HSV.
* Mixing these saturated colors with black ([shades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tints_and_shades)) leaves saturation unchanged.
* In HSL, mixing with white ([tints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tints_and_shades)) leaves saturation unchanged.
* In HSL, mixing with both black and white ([tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tints_and_shades)) reduces saturation.
* In HSV, mixing with white ([tints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tints_and_shades)) reduces saturation.

### YUV

[YUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) is a color model with `luma` and `chrominance` components. Sometimes `YUV` is also named `YCrCb`, where `Cr` is the red projection plane and `Cb` is the blue projection plane. It was invented when engineers wanted color television in a black-and-white infrastructure.

There are several [YUV pixel formats](https://www.fourcc.org/yuv.php), the recommended formats for video rendering are:
* 4:4:4 (32 bpp)
  * [AYUV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/recommended-8-bit-yuv-formats-for-video-rendering#ayuv)
