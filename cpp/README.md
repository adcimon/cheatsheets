## Libraries

A [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) is a collection of resources used by programs. These resources may include code, data, templates, documentation, etc.

There are 2 types of libraries, [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library) and [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library).

* Static files (`lib`) can contain either `static` libraries (containing object files) or `import` libraries (containing symbols to allow the linker to link `dll` or `so` files).
* Dynamic files (`dll` or `so`) contain `dynamic` libraries.

Dynamic libraries have 2 types of [dynamic linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker).
* Implicit. When a `lib` file is provided by the `dll` creator along with appropriate headers. This `lib` is an `import` library, merely a descriptor of the target library, it contains entry point, addresses, etc. It doesn't contain any code and must be passed to the linker.
* Explicit. When the library is manually loaded with `LoadLibrary` functions. The `lib` file isn't needed, but it requires more effort to find exports, addresses, and call functions through pointers.
